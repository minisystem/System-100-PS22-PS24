Roland System 100 Model 101/102 Power Supply Replacement
============

Replaces Roland part # PS22 (110V) or PS24 (220V). I had a Model 102 come in that was missing its power supply so I designed a replacement. It is a straight clone of the schematic from the Model 102 service manual. The BOM from the service manual can be used directly with the exception of the 2SD234 power transistors (replaced with TIP31A equivalent) and the diode bridges (replaced with individual 1N4003).
